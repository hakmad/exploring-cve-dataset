# Exploring the CVE Dataset

This repo contains a notebook for exploring the CVE dataset using machine
learning methods.

## About

This notebook uses data from the CVE dataset ranging from 1998 to late 2022.
The purpose of this notebook is as following:

1. As an exercise in data science methods, including cleaning data, feature
   engineering, training models and evaluating prediction performance.
2. Understanding the relationship between CWE types and the CVSS ratings by
   removing certain features and including the CWE types. The performance of
   models will be evaluated and used to understand whether or not there is a
   clear relationship between the type of vulnerability and the vulnerability
   severity.

## Requirements

This project uses the following libraries:

- ~~`selenium`: used for web scraping.~~ Note: this is no longer required.
- `pandas`: used for dataset analysis.
- `matplotlib`: used for plotting graphs.
- `sklearn`: used for machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used by this dataset can be found
[here](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/), and a copy of the
dataset can be found in the [`data.tsv`](/data.tsv) file.

Note: the website has gone through numerous changes since the dataset was first
scraped from the website. The dataset was first scraped in November 2022 and
was scraped from this specific website as part of certain requirements at the
time. The code that is used for scraping the website should **not** be used:
this is now legacy code.
